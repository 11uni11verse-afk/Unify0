## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must Fix Before Launch

### Google Analytics (10 minutes) 🔴

**Current Status:** Using placeholder `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`

**Why It Matters:**
- Can't track user behavior
- Can't measure conversion rates
- Can't optimize based on data
- **But:** Website will still function without it

**Action Required:**
1. Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Create property (5 min)
3. Get Measurement ID: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`
4. Update `index.html` lines 66 and 71
5. Test in Realtime view

**Time to Fix:** 10 minutes  
**Can Launch Without:** Yes, but not recommended

---

## 🟡 OPTIONAL (Can Add Later)

### Contact Form Email Delivery
- Form works but emails don't send
- Can use email link as fallback
- **Impact:** Low - users can still contact you

### Guide Downloads
- Buttons exist but don't download PDFs
- **Impact:** Low - content is visible
