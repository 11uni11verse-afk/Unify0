broad immigration crackdown \u2013 which has seen international students arrested and detained for engaging in pro-Palestinian speech. \u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State Department said approximately 16,000 visas had been pulled for DUIs, 12,000 for assaults and 8,000 for thefts.

and that higher processing priorities will be &#8220;afforded to providers who manage their international student enrolments broadly in accordance with their indicative allocations under the National Planning Level&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The direction will also promote greater utilisation of allocations to more fairly respond to the needs of small vocational education and training providers<br /><sub><sup>Julian Hill, assistant minister for international education</sup></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The assistant minister believes this system will allow for greater &#8220;utilisation of allocations to more fairly respond to the needs of small vocational education and training providers&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with Ministerial Direction 111, certain visa categories continue to receive <a href=\"https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-processing-times/visa-processing-priorities/student-visa?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">priority processing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information sessions will be held with education providers in November and December to explain the operation of the MD 115.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hill first <a href=\"https://thepienews.com/australia-open-for-business-but-integrity-comes-first-says-hill/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">flagged</a> the new directive at the 2025 Australian International Education Conference (AIEC), where his speech focused on the government&#8217;s goals of sustainable growth and sector integrity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite progress toward the government\u2019s goal of sustainable growth, Hill told the Canberra audience that more work is needed to improve the \u201ccomposition, distribution and integrity\u201d of the overall student cohort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://thepienews.com/australia-new-student-visa-processing-directive-to-replace-ministerial-direction-111/\">Australia: new student visa processing directive to replace Ministerial Direction 111</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://thepienews.com\">The PIE News</a>.</p>"}]}, {"id": "n_0fdffca232c0", "title": "Where was Jose Berrios during run and what's next for Blue Jays starter?", "excerpt": "Where was Jose Berrios during run and what's next for Blue Jays starter?", "link": "https://ca.news.yahoo.com/where-jose-berrios-during-run-165045031.html", "date": "2025-11-10T16:50:45+00:00", "source": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "category": "Education", "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1503676260728-1c00da094a0b?w=1200&h=800&fit=crop", "readTime": "3 min read", "impact": "Low", "country": "Global", "city": null, "location": null, "contentHTML": ""}, {"id": "n_ca689a72bb22", "title": "Hamid Gharda: rethinking agent partnerships in UK higher education", "excerpt": "It\u2019s time for UK universities to move from volume to value \u2013 and from compliance to confidence \u2013 in how they manage and measure their international recruitment agents.\nThe post Hamid Gharda: rethinking agent partnerships in UK higher educat", "link": "https://thepienews.com/hamid-gharda-rethinking-agent-partnerships-in-uk-higher-education/", "date": "2025-11-10T15:55:20+00:00", "source": "thepienews.com", "category": "Education", "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1503676260728-1c00da094a0b?w=1200&h=800&fit=crop", "readTime": "3 min read", "impact": "Low", "country": "United Kingdom", "city": null, "location": null, "contentHTML": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "", "value": "<p>In the brisk autumn light, across the UK higher-education landscape, one stubborn truth is now impossible to ignore: for many institutions, the management of international-recruitment agents remains messy, fragmented and far from strategic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the clamour for joined-up data, digital tools, and genuinely collaborative partnerships, the typical process still resembles a patchwork of spreadsheets, subjective reviews, and one-off meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we gathered at the recent Beyond Compliance conference, colleagues from Sheffield to Leicester to London shared the same refrain: \u201cWe know agents matter. We just don\u2019t know how well we know them.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is not recruitment volume but recruitment quality \u2013 not simply whether agents deliver numbers, but whether they represent institutional values, provide transparent data and contribute to genuine student success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From compliance to collaboration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The era of compliance checklists and reactive audits is no longer sufficient. In a world where visa integrity, student welfare, market reputation and digital-first operations converge, agent-management must evolve from procurement to partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That shift requires three interlocking changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>In a world where visa integrity, student welfare, market reputation and digital-first operations converge, agent-management must evolve from procurement to partnership</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>First: unified, reliable data</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too many institutions run agent networks in silos \u2013 recruitment teams hold one list, compliance another, finance a third. Without a single source of truth, decision-making remains vulnerable to bias and blind spots. Aligning onboarding, conversion, trip reports and student-outcome data gives universities real line-of-sight on which agents consistently deliver value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Second: operational embedding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to deploy a dashboard or hold an annual review. Teams across recruitment, admissions, compliance and finance must use the same agent-performance tool under shared governance and workflows. This discipline closes the gap between <em>what we think we know</em> and <em>what the data shows</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Third: strategic narrative</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If agent quality is truly a strategic priority, it must be visible at the senior-leadership level \u2013 in metrics, dashboards and sector conversations. The louder universities become about transparent, evidence-based agent management, the faster best practice becomes the norm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Digital transformation in action</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.samsglobal.co.uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMS Global</a>, we\u2019re seeing universities link recruitment-agent data from their CRM with performance-analytics platforms such as SAMS Manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result: a move from transactional relationships \u2013 <em>\u201cagent delivered X students\u201d</em> \u2013 to performance-centred partnerships \u2013 <em>\u201cagent delivered Y students who progressed, succeeded and became alumni ambassadors.\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By giving multiple departments the autonomy and permissions to contribute directly, universities are unifying their view of agent quality and freeing staff time for strategy rather than spreadsheets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new academic year presents a pivotal moment. With markets shifting and student expectations evolving, universities that elevate agent-management now will be best placed for the next wave of global mobility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to move from volume to value, from spreadsheets to dashboards, and from compliance to confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because in an era of complexity and competition, the institutions that truly understand <em>who</em> their agents are, <em>how</em> they act and <em>why</em> they deliver will lead \u2014 not just in recruitment, but in student success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-261631\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://thepienews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HG-head-shot-Edited-1-75-.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the author:</strong> Hamid Gharda is director of business development at SAMS Global, specialising in digital solutions for international-student recruitment, agent management and higher-education market strategy.

On streets and in shops across the UK this, someone will have been be selling poppies. And today, on Remembrance Sunday, at War Memorials from tiny villages to Whitehall, people will gather for a period of silence. A moment to reflect, to remember.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me personally, there is a family connection. My paternal great-grandfather was killed in WWI, leaving four young children. His name is on the vast Tyne Cot memorial in Belgium, one of 35,000 of the missing who died in the Ypres Salient after August 16, 1917, and have no known grave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also think of another memorial, the one I gathered around for the years I worked at <a href=\"https://sheffield.ac.uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sheffield University</a>. This is the moving tribute to the students and staff who lost their lives in two World Wars.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This carved stone monument at the University\u2019s core was once located in the original library, and it contains arguably the most sacred and painful book in its collection \u2013 a Book of Remembrance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheffield University had its own battalion in WWI and it was almost completely destroyed on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Some 512 young men lost their lives in a single day. I was once given permission to lift off the glass cover and open the book. It was shocking, each page crammed full of so many hundreds of names.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many of those students, hopefully joining up and travelling to France was the first time they had been overseas, just as it was for my great-grandfather. He left his mining village on the unluckiest of journeys \u2013 first to Gallipoli where he was gassed, and then to France where he died in the mud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, students have a very different opportunity for travel, for connection. A century after my great-grandfather died, I have travelled the world in peacetime thanks to international education. I\u2019ve been to Delhi and seen the vast war memorial at India Gate with its eternal flame and walls of other names \u2013 Hindu, Sikh, Muslim. I have friends from China whose relatives long ago would have dug the trenches as part of as part of the 140,000 strong Chinese Labour Corps for the British and French armies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remembrance Day isn\u2019t a British only tradition \u2013 a whole world was drawn into those terrible events.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What international students teach us now&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have international students friends who don\u2019t need a poppy to remind them to remember because they come from countries with current experience of conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who are they? A refugee scholar from Syria working on environmental sustainability. A Gaza scholar who rejects the language of resilience and uses her research to build deep understanding. A friend in Singapore who has family in Russia and Ukraine. And the Afghan scholars who have become not only friends but family, those who teach us all that the peace to sit with your loved ones and share a meal is never to be taken for granted. That for young girls and women to access education, university, careers and have choices is a right hard won that must be cherished. Each of them is also my teacher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>As the world changes, nationalism grows and spheres of influence are fortified by economic and literal weapons, those who understand one another are more important than ever</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is also why I believe in international education. Peace takes understanding. It takes work. As the world changes, nationalism grows and spheres of influence are fortified by economic and literal weapons, those who understand one another are more important than ever.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a tragedy that language courses close because, as John le Carr\u00e9 said, learning a language is an act of friendship. But international education in all its forms is also what my <a href=\"https://www.nisau.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NISAU</a> friends call a \u2018living bridge\u2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it happens through traditional programmes of overseas study, short courses, institutional partnerships, TNE or internationalisation at home, global education offers a precious opportunity to meet in peace. To gain a perspective not only on what others think and how they see the world, but about yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why it matters that #WeAreInternational&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When years ago we founded a campaign called #WeAreInternational , it was a statement not about a structure of higher education but about who we are and want to be. It doesn\u2019t mean abandoning your identity, it means opening it up to possibility. That is in itself an education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Donne famously wrote that no man is an island but that we are deeply connected to one another, all of us connected to the continent. And when others are harmed, we are all diminished. That the bell that tolls for any life is ringing for humanity too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Remembrance Sunday this year, as we are urged never to forget, there is also an implicit call to action \u2013 not to wage war but to build peace. How do we do that? Nobody is pretending it\u2019s easy, but I think the education we are privileged to support has a very human part to play.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of the words of my Afghan scholar friend Naimat speaking at <a href=\"https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">City St George\u2019s University of London</a> to students earlier this week. As the minute\u2019s silence begins on today, I will think of my great-grandfather Robert, the lost students of Sheffield University, and the words of this international student who knows of what he speaks.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve peace at all times, we must do three things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Acknowledge the past: we must study and accept the hard lessons, the disconnected dots, and the mistakes of history.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Act in the present: we must stand up against injustice wherever it occurs, recognising that a violation of human rights in one corner of the world eventually casts a shadow over all of us.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prioritise the future: we must commit to sustained dialogue \u2013 not just talk, but a genuine exchange of ideas where all voices, especially the most marginalised, are heard and valued.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Dialogue, he says, is the non-violent tool we possess to sustain peace.

She wanted to study at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York State, but didn\u2019t want to spend tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition, since international students don\u2019t qualify for federal aid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, she decided to start her higher education journey at Monroe Community College, also in Rochester, where tuition is cheaper. T, now in her second semester, has made friends with dozens of other international students at MCC, who have helped her feel less lonely being so far away from family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are times where I don\u2019t feel like I fit in. Or I feel alone sometimes. The most important thing is the friends that you have,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>International student enrolments have surged at US community colleges ever since the pandemic, including this fall. As community colleges host more international students, administrators are looking for ways to make them feel welcome on campuses where most students are local commuters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way international students at MCC can find support is through campus life. T serves as the president of the Global Union \u2013 a student-run club for international students, immigrant students, and anyone interested in learning about other cultures. Through her role, she greets new students, helps them to overcome challenges, and organises events to help them showcase their cultures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes, you need to be around people that have the same feeling as yours. When we are in the same club with immigrants, refugees, or other international students, we feel like we fit in with each other,&#8221; T said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An unexpected increase</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of President Trump\u2019s policies, analysts <a href=\"https://thepienews.com/international-student-decline-to-cost-the-us-7bn/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">predicted a 15% drop</a> in total international students at American colleges and universities this fall. Experts warned that the Trump administration\u2019s near month-long pause on visa interviews, travel bans, and war against many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious universities would harm enrolment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, this fall\u2019s international student enrolment across all degree programs, including OPT, grew by 0.8%, according to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (<a href=\"https://distributedprogress.substack.com/p/sevis-beats-expectationsbig-time\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SEVIS</a>) data that the Department of Homeland Security publishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community colleges have helped to move the needle. For associate degree programs, international student enrolment increased by 9.1%, with community colleges welcoming nearly 5,500 more students than last year. Meanwhile, enrolment shrunk slightly for master\u2019s programs and hardly changed for bachelor\u2019s programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than choosing not to study in the US this fall, it seems like students are choosing different kinds of degrees or schools. That\u2019s according to Chris Glass, director of Boston College\u2019s higher education program, who <a href=\"https://distributedprogress.substack.com/p/sevis-beats-expectationsbig-time\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently analysed</a> the latest SEVIS data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re to take this data at face value, the system is far more resilient than the tumultuous headlines would suggest,\u201d Glass previously <a href=\"https://thepienews.com/us-sevis-data-appears-to-contradict-sectors-worst-fears/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>The PIE<strong> News</strong></em></a> .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on his analysis, the over 9% growth of international students at community colleges may not be a fluke. Glass argues that international students gravitate toward schools with less political spotlight, more affordable tuition, and access to opportunities after graduation. Community colleges check all of those boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MCC is hosting more international students now than before the pandemic. This fall, the campus\u2019 international student body grew by 35%, hosting 120 students from over 30 countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MCC\u2019s international recruiting efforts for soccer, baseball, and other sports has helped to draw students from across continents, said Carly O\u2019Keefe, MCC\u2019s assistant director of global education and international services. The current men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer team roster has a combined 34 international students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, unlike many other community colleges, MCC has dorms. For T, attending a college with on-campus dorms was critical, since she had no family or friends in Rochester to live with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O\u2019Keefe said international students at MCC bring ideas and culture from across the globe, enriching a campus where most students are local. Some local students \u2013 limited by jobs, financial constraints, or family obligations \u2013 have never traveled overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re able to make friendships with people from other countries that they maybe would have never connected with otherwise,&#8221; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finding a community through campus life&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wall of the Global Union office is decorated with dozens of paintings of hot air balloons containing flags, created by students to represent their countries. Colourful cloth flags and souvenirs from across the world fill the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the time when I saw the Korean flag, I was so proud,&#8221; said Onyu Cha, a first-semester international student from South Korea studying nursing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-261572\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://thepienews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCC-Global-Union-Office-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hot air balloon paintings at Global Union office. Photo: MCC Global Union</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Onyu made friends with other Koreans through campus life and through her sister, who also lives in Rochester. Recently, she and other Korean students went to her sister\u2019s house to cook food for the holiday of Chuseok, a mid-autumn harvest festival often referred to as Korean Thanksgiving.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through her role as the vice-president of the Global Union, Onyu has got to learn about the cultures of other students. Currently, the club is planning for an event to celebrate holidays from across the world, all on one day. That\u2019s similar to last year\u2019s Global Fusion Festival \u2013 an event in the campus atrium to celebrate the cultures of all MCC students. It featured African drummers, Ukrainian dancers, and food from across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judichael Razafintsalama \u2013 a student from Madagascar who graduated from MCC last May \u2013 said serving as the Global Union president allowed him to support his fellow international students.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Having international students on campus at a community college can be really enriching to a local community</p>\n<cite>Dr. Melissa Whatley, William &amp; Mary</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer before starting his first year at MCC, Razafintsalama landed in Rochester around 2am. When he got to his dorm, he realised he had no food. The vending\u00a0machines were empty, the campus\u2019 food services were closed, and he hadn\u2019t set up rideshare on his phone. To get groceries, he walked two hours to a Walmart and back, carrying four bags while jet lagged.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, international students come together to help the Office of Global Education provide packages of canned food, granola bars and utensils for incoming international students.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We even helped two of our students move into their apartment and make sure that everything is settled after going through what I went through,&#8221; Razafintsalama said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Razafintsalama said he&#8217;s had the chance to teach others at MCC about his country and his culture. Most students he encountered had never met anyone from Madagascar, the island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey usually attach it to the cartoon movie,\u201d he said. \u201cIt&#8217;s great because I can see that people are interested in my country and to see what it actually is like.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supporting international students\u2019 social and housing needs is critical to making them feel welcome, said Dr. Melissa Whatley, an assistant professor of higher education at William &amp; Mary University. Her research group recently <a href=\"https://thepienews.com/new-study-maps-internationalisation-efforts-in-us-community-colleges/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released a report</a> on international education at community colleges, finding that 82% hosted international students.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatley hopes that these colleges are providing international students with campus life opportunities and, if they don\u2019t have dorms, are helping students to find housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Having international students on campus at a community college can be really enriching to a local community, to the extent that the community is equipped to welcome them,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Concerns over travel ban</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the US hosts over 1.2 million international students or recent graduates, according to SEVIS data. The dataset doesn\u2019t distinguish between students and graduates working temporarily through Optional Practical Training (OPT). More in-depth statistics will become available once the Institute of International Education publishes its annual report <a href=\"https://www.iie.org/research-initiatives/fall-international-enrollments-snapshot-reports/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">later in November</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, because of President <a href=\"https://thepienews.com/trump-bans-citizens-of-12-countries-from-entering-us/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump\u2019s travel ban</a>, some prospective international students have been restricted from studying in the US. That includes Burmese students who didn\u2019t secure a visa <a href=\"https://www.presidentsalliance.org/directories-2-directories-international-students/%23:~:text=The%2520three-week%2520suspension%2520together,than%252060,000%2520fewer%2520jobs%2520nationwide.\">before June 9</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MCC has seen an uptick in Burmese students ever since a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-earthquake-civil-war-junta-thailand-cbf36685881ea890202256d4607a02ed\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">civil war broke out</a> in the country, interrupting higher education for many students. The war began in 2021 when military forces toppled the country\u2019s democratically elected government. Last spring, MCC still hosted more students from Burma than from any other country, O\u2019Keefe said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Burma is among the 12 countries included in Trump&#8217;s travel ban, impacting all immigrant and non-immigrant visas.

That\u2019s where TransferMate came in.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas sees the collaboration bridging a long-standing gap between automation and trusted global payments. \u201cBy integrating our regulated payment network directly into IODM\u2019s workflow, we\u2019ve eliminated the manual friction that institutions face in processing student debt payments,\u201d he explains. \u201cInstitutions can now accept payments in over 140 currencies from more than 200 countries and territories, all with complete traceability and compliance built in.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, TransferMate and IODM close the loop. As Mark puts it: \u201cWe give universities a single unified solution from issuing the invoice, communicating, receiving the payment, allocating it, and reconciling it, whilst also delivering a better student experience.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The scale of the problem, and why time matters</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pain inflicted by student debt is widespread across the education sector. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing receivable days since outstanding (DSO) at 20-30% above average,\u201d Mark notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As debts age, the chances of recovery decrease. It\u2019s even harder when students move abroad or pay in foreign currencies. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a university to have somewhere between 1-3% of revenue sitting in aged receivables beyond 90 days,\u201d Mark points out. \u201cOnce it goes beyond 90 days, it starts to really move into that write-off category.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student debt can be accrued in any country, whether the student is domestic or international. However, when a student is overseas, the complexity of collection multiplies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas acknowledges that the lack of visibility and traceability in traditional banking channels often compounds the issue. \u201cWhen institutions rely on multiple intermediaries to move funds across borders, it\u2019s easy for payments to go missing, arrive with incomplete data, or cost more than anticipated,\u201d he explains. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>When institutions rely on multiple intermediaries to move funds across borders, it\u2019s easy for payments to go missing, arrive with incomplete data, or cost more than anticipated</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBy processing transactions directly through TransferMate\u2019s regulated global network, IODM and their clients gain access to preferential foreign exchange rates, and full traceability from the moment a payment is made to when it\u2019s reconciled, helping them recover funds faster and reduce the percentage of debt that slips into write-off territory.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compliance, auditability, and fewer disputes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compliance is another blocker in collecting international debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-border payments require adherence to multiple jurisdictions, necessitating robust anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. However, many institutions aren\u2019t equipped to handle these requirements. Practicalities, such as time zones and language barriers, add even more friction. Combine all of those factors, and you naturally increase the risk and cost of collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many institutions might say, \u201cWhy bother?\u201d and write off that debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBecause TransferMate is regulated, it gives the institution comfort around AML and KYC\u201d, Thomas says. \u201cFX conversion and payments are handled within the platform, reducing exposure to compliance issues, banking routing errors, or chargebacks.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That transparency builds trust for both the institution and the student, while helping institutions track payments and keep a complete record of student payment history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Delivering an automated end-to-end payment collection process</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a student leaves with an outstanding balance, the integrated flow kicks in. \u201cIODM integrates with the institution\u2019s ERP via API,\u201d Mark says. \u201cThat triggers a communication to the student, reminding them of the outstanding amount and providing a link to payment options.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas continues, \u201cThe student pays in their home currency; TransferMate processes the payment and FX, settles the payment across borders, and pushes funds into the institution\u2019s account.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit is two-sided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students enjoy a streamlined user experience, and the institution can rely on a seamless process for receiving and automating reconciliation. The institution effectively outsources its collections workflow to IODM and TransferMate, freeing its team to focus on other tasks rather than chasing manual payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Results that move the needle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark points to the partnership&#8217;s consistent performance. \u201cOn average, we see a reduction in DSO between 15% and 30% within the first 12 months,\u201d Mark reports. \u201cAnd a decrease in manual interventions. Our metrics show 40-60% fewer touches per case compared to legacy manual processes.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cash flow improves quickly once onboarded. \u201cAccommodation clients reported more than a 70% uplift in cash receipts in the first 12 months,\u201d Mark says. \u201cUniversities have seen dramatic reductions in debtor days, increasing cash flow almost immediately. Institutions that might have budgeted for 5-10% of aged receivables unrecovered are now tracking a lot lower due to the automation.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked to summarise the partnership in a sentence, Mark doesn\u2019t hesitate for an answer: \u201cIt empowers institutions to eliminate payment friction for international students through end-to-end automation of receivables workflows, and to reclaim cash that strengthens working capital instead of sitting in an aged receivables ledger.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The human payoff</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, recovered funds become student benefits. Institutions can see money once uncollected find its way back into their bank account and budget, eventually being deployed into areas needed for a better student experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what institution doesn\u2019t want that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.transfermate.com/company/contact-us\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Get started</a> with IODM and TransferMate today and turn student debt from a liability to an asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-261559\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://thepienews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tm_logo_colour_300dpi-1024x229.jpg\" style=\"width: 435px; height: auto;\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the author:</strong> TransferMate is the leading global payments provider helping universities and education providers collect international fees faster, easier, and more securely.
